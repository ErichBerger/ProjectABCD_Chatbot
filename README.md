# ProjectABCD_Chatbot

This project is for a ICS 352 - Machine Learning at Metro State University

All that needs to be done to add this to a website is to copy the chatbot.php code into your website file structure. On the page you'd like to add it to, use 
```
<?php require('filepath/chatbot.php); ?>
```
to send the functionality. Make sure to change
```
action="index.php"
```
in the form tag to whichever page you are requiring it on.
